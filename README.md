# Abstract
## *Firstly, Who are IDPs?*
**An internally displaced person (IDP) is someone who is forced to leave their home but who remains within their country's borders. They are often referred to as refugees, although they do not fall within the legal definitions of a refugee.**

They have been forced from their homes for many of the same reasons as refugees, but have not crossed an international border. Often persecuted or under attack by their own governments, they are frequently in a more desperate situation than refugees. 
They also **outnumber refugees two to one.** No international agency has a formal mandate to aid them. But, they are increasingly at the forefront of the humanitarian agenda. They are sometimes called ‘internal refugees’, but are more often known as internally displaced persons.

# Problem Statement
Now, to truly comprehend the gravity of the situation- the number of such unfortunately uprooted communties, Let's also give the stats a glance. 

According to the Global IDP Survey, there are more than 13 million internally displaced persons in Africa, 5–6 million in Asia (including the Middle East), 3 million in Europe and 3–4 million in the Americas.

The statistics on internally displaced persons generally count only those who are
displaced by conflict and persecution. 

But, **millions more have been uprooted within their own countries by natural disasters.**
